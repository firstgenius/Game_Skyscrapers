## More About Game

Skyscrapers is a logical game in the placement of houses. In this game you need to place houses of different heights on the game board, so that the number of visible houses from a certain position was equal to the number in the tooltip.

So, the game board is a square N x N, with hints on the sides. The object of the game is to place a skyscraper 1 to N high in each cell so that:

1)  No two skyscrapers in a row were the same height.

2)  No two skyscrapers in the column were the same height.

3)The number of visible skyscrapers from a certain direction (hint with arrow) was equal to the number in the hint. Note that the taller skyscrapers obscure the visibility of the lower skyscrapers behind the taller skyscrapers.
